# Product Definition Document #
###############################


# Product definition document defines some of the metadata common to all the datasets belonging to the products. 
# It also describes the measurements that product has and some of the properties of the measurements. 
# A Product definition added to your Data Cube for each type of dataset.

# Product definition is a .yaml or .json file

# Sample Product Definitions are kept in datacube-core/docs/config_samples/dataset_types/

datacube product add <path-to-dataset-type-yml>


# Development in customization phase includes:
#	- Gathering Product Definition requirements for PFC
# 	- Writing custom Product Definitions for data sets not covered by samples collection
#	- Preparing automatic loading of the product definitions in the cube setup.
