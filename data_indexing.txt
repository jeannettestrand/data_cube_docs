# Product Definitions

# Product description document defines some of the metadata common to all the datasets belonging to the products. 
# It also describes the measurements that product has and some of the properties of the measurements. 
# A Product definition added to your Data Cube for each type of dataset.

# Product definition is a .yaml or .json file

# Sample Product Definitions are kept in datacube-core/docs/config_samples/dataset_types/

datacube product add <path-to-dataset-type-yml>


# Future development includes writing custom Product Definitions for data sets
